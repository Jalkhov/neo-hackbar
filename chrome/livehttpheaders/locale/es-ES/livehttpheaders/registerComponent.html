<BODY>
To be able to display headers information in the PageInfo tab of
Mozilla or Firefox the nsHeaderInfo component must be registered.<br>
This component should be found in the file Mozilla/Components/nsHeaderInfo.js.<p>

Registration should have been done by the LiveHTTPHeaders installation.<br>
However this sometimes does not work.<br>
Follow these steps to enable Mozilla or Firefox to find and register the
component:<br>
<ul>
<li>Delete the file <code><b>Mozilla/Components/compreg.dat</b></code></li>
<li>Delete the file <code><b>Mozilla/Components/xpti.dat</b></code></li>
</ul>
These two files should be recreated automatically by Mozilla or Firefox
when it is next started.<p>

<b>Note</b>: if you installed LiveHTTPHeaders in you <b>profile</b>, there 
is a copy of the nsHeadersInfo.js file in your profile/components directory.  
You need to copy it in Mozilla/Components directory first and follow the 
directive above after.<br>
