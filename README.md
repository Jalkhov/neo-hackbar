**Tested in:**

* Pale Moon **29.4.4**
* Basilisk **2021.12.13**

This version of the Hackbar fixes many bugs with respect to some existing variants on the web, has an improved but not overdone interface and comes with some of the best extensions for pentesting, among them:

* [Live Http Headers](http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/) **v0.17.1** | by Daniel Savard, Nikolas Co  (Oficial site Dead)

  View HTTP headers of a page and while browsing.

* [NoRedirect](http://code.kliu.org/noredirect/) **v1.1.1.**  | by Kai Liu

  NoRedirect lets the user take control of HTTP redirects. It can be used  to interdict an ISP's DNS search redirection hijacks, preview/screen  "shortened" URLs (e.g., TinyURL), stop the annoying redirection of  "smart" error pages, etc.

* [Tamperdata](http://tamperdata.mozdev.org/) **v11.0.1** | by Adam Judson (Oficial site Dead)

  Use tamperdata to view and modify HTTP/HTTPS headers and post parameters...

* Viewsource (Missing info)

* Hacksearch **v1.1.1.** | by QBurst, Rejah Rehim A A, Sreenath Sasikumar

  Search in some of the ways hackers would to gather google indexed data about your website so that you can secure it yourself.
